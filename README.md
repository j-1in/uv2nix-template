# python.nix

A python development environment using flakes, pyproject.nix and uv2nix.

- The flake is loaded using direnv on entry to the project directory.
- Using pyproject.nix a development shell is created
  with all packages found in the local pyproject.toml file fetched from nixpkgs.
- uv2nix uses pyproject.nix in the background,
  but builds the packages found in pyproject.toml on the fly.
  It also updates the project live without the need of a manual reload.

## Shells

Three shells are available:

1. The **default** shell is an impure shell is available for developing on non NixOS systems
   or if one is needed for different reasons. You can use uv to manage dependencies.
2. A **pure**  shell is based on pyproject.nix.
   Please keep in mind, that all packages need to be available in nixpkgs.
3. If you want to have your package always up to date with,
   you can use the **uv2nix** shell.

## Workflows

- `flake.yml` checks if all outputs of the flake are correct.
  Only because it runs on your machine, does not mean it will on all supported systems.
- `pypi.yml` publishes the package to [pypi](https://pypi.org/).
